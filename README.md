# Deep-Learning-Cheat-Sheets
Cheat Sheet - RNN and CNN
Deep Learning cheatsheets for Stanford's CS 230
Goal
This repository aims at summing up in the same place all the important notions that are covered in Stanford's CS 230 Deep Learning course, and include:

Cheatsheets detailing everything about convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, as well as the tips and tricks to have in mind when training a deep learning model.
All elements of the above combined in an ultimate compilation of concepts, to have with you at all times!
